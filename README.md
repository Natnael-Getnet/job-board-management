## 📖 How to Use

1. **Adding a New Job**:

   - Navigate to the "Add Job" form.
   - Fill out all the required fields (e.g., job title, type, salary, location, and company information).
   - Submit the form to add the job.

2. **Editing a Job**:

   - Navigate to an existing job detail page.
   - Click on "Edit" to pre-fill the form with existing job data.
   - Update the details and save changes.

3. **Real-Time Fetching**:

   - Job details are fetched dynamically from the API when a job is viewed or edited.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If the API fails to fetch or update job data, errors are logged to the console.

## 🌐 API Endpoints

The project integrates with a RESTful API to manage job data. Below are the endpoints used:

- **GET** `/api/jobs/:id` - Fetch details of a specific job.
- **PUT** `/api/jobs/:id` - Update the details of an existing job.
- **POST** `/api/jobs` - Add a new job listing.

> Ensure the backend server is running and accessible when using the app. Replace these endpoints with the actual routes if necessary.

## 🛡️ Security & Best Practices

- Always validate form inputs on the server.
- Sanitize API requests and responses to prevent injection attacks.
- Use .env files to store sensitive information like API keys.
